Welcome to my Blog!

Hi, I'm Yutian (Mark) Chen. Currently freshman in CMU and majoring in Statistics & Machine Learning. [Here's my resume]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/resume.pdf)

Currently I'm interested in:

* Computer Vision [View Related Posts]({{site.baseurl}}/tags.html#Computer%20Vision)
* Natural Language Processing [View Related Posts]({{site.baseurl}}/tags.html#NLP)
* Decentralized Finance (DeFi) [View Related Posts]({{site.baseurl}}/tags.html#Decentralized%20Finance)

## Some of My Works ...

With the help from professor Shi and doctor Xu, I proposed a neural network model that automatically analyze cardiac MRI sequence and provides semantic segmentation in paper *Myocardial Segmentation of Cardiac MRI Sequence with Temporal Consistency for Coronary Artery Disease Diagnosis*.

The model uses U-net with residual block (Res U-net) as encoder and bi-directional Conv-LSTM as decoder. Through the bi-directional Conv-LSTM decoder, we successfully introduce temporal consistency constraint in sementic segmentation and improve the accuaracy of cMRI segmentation.
