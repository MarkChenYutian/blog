A minimum `three.js` scene needs four basic elements:

1. A scene that contain objects
2. Some objects
3. A Camera
4. A Renderer

## Scene

Scene is like a container. We can put objects, models, lights, etc. in it.

```js
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
```

## Objects

Objects can be
* primitive geometries
* imported models
* particles
* lights
* ...

A **Mesh** is a combination of **geometry (the shape)** and **material (appearance)**.

### Geometry

We will aim to create a red cube in this scene. To do so, we can first instentiate a `BoxGeometry`.

```js
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1)
```

### Material

We will use the `MeshPhongMaterial` in this scene. This is a basic material built in the Three.js with light and shadow.

```js
const material = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({ color: 0xff5100 })
```

Now, we can combine them into a mesh

```js
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)
scene.add(mesh)
```

At last, we need to *add the mesh into the scene*.

## Light

To see the objects in the scene, we need light in the scene (or we will see pure black shadows instead). Therefore, we will create a simple light in the scene.

```js
const intensity = 1;
const light = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, intensity);
light.position.set(-2, 2, 4);
scene.add(light);
```

## Camera

Camera is a non-visible, and will provide the renderer the perspective to render scene on canvas. There are multiple types of camera in three.js, and we will use `PerspectiveCamera` here.

To instentiate a camera, we need to provide several crucial parameters of it

| Parameter Name | Description |
|-----|----|
| FOV | Field of view, the vertical vision angle (a large FOV will lead to distortion on the edge of result) |
| Aspect Ratio | The width of the render divided by the height. |

```js
const sizes = {
    width: 500,
    height: 350
}
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(55, sizes.width / sizes.height)
scene.add(camera)
```

## Renderer

We can create a `<canvas>` object to show the result of renderer.

| Parameter Name | Description |
|-----|-----|
| canvas | The DOM Element that renderer output will be draw on |
| alpha | The renderer will have a transparent background |

```js
const canvas_dom = document.querySelector("canvas#webgl")
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({
    canvas: canvas_dom,
    alpha: true
})
renderer.setSize(sizes.width, sizes.height)
```

## Finish!

Then, we can call the `render()` function on the `renderer` with `scene` and the `camera`.

```js
renderer.render(scene, camera)
```

Yet, there is one more thing ... Our camera and cube are at the origin of the scene! We can only see the triangles draw by renderer from the "outside" direction, so the render result will be empty now.

The fix will be simple - just move the camera around a little bit

```js
camera.position.z = 3;
camera.position.y = 0.7;
camera.position.x = -1;
```
