## What is C0 Language

The programming language C0 is a carefully crafted subset of the C aimed at teaching introductory algorithms and imperative programming. It is used in **15-122 Principles of Imperative Programming** and **15-411 Compiler Design** by more than 600 students each semester.

## About This Project

This project is my project for Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) in CMU. More importantly, it's an attempt to improve students' 15-122 learning experience.

By employing various visualization and front-end technology, we make it possible to execute and visualize C0 Language on any device with modern browser. This project also allows instructors of 15-122 to embed runnable code exerciese in Learning Material System (LMS) like Canvas or Diderot thus creating a more interactive learning environment.

## Live Demo

Try copy the following C0 code segment into the *Code Editor* then hit Compile & Run to see the result!

```c
#use <conio>

int main() {
    int*[] A = alloc_array(int*, 4);
    A[1] = alloc(int);
    *A[1] = 2;
    printf("The value @ A[1] is a pointer pointing to %d", *A[1]);
    return 0;
}
```

You can also set breakpoint on **Line 8** by clicking on the left of line number. A red dot ðŸ”´ will appear if the breakpoint is set successfully.
