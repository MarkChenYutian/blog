## Preface & Disclaimer

This post is the first in a series of posts about the relationship between perception and AGI. This is also a personal reflection on my own research direction from very abstract and metaphysical point of view. Some arguments in this post may not have strong supporting evidence but rather more of a belief, I will put <u>underline</u> for such arguments.

I also want to admit my own limitation in this topic. Some arguments may seem naive for professionals in philosophy, linguistic and other domains, and I am open to any feedback. I may also re-iterate and update this post for many times in the future.
